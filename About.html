        <h2>My name is Sarah Savely. My undergraduate majors are International Business and Management Information Systems. I also have a minor in Chinese (Mandarin).</h2>

        <h3>
            I am extremely interested in understanding how international companies maintain databases and expand them as their companies grow. However, my most significant interest is being able to incorporate my
            studies as an international business major into my career. I am bilingual in Mandarin Chinese, thus would like to work for an international company who has expats in China. I pride myself on keeping
            up to date with China-United States relations and would be a valuable asset in compliance and cyber security regulations.
        </h3>

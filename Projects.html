            I completed a course on databases where I, in a group of 5, helped build the database using SQL Server.  After building the database relations and successfully implementing dummy data,
            we were able to run queries that extracted specific information. This project required that I know how to build an ERD (entity relationship diagram) from scratch, normalize that diagram, and completely
            understand every possible instance the example company would need to account for in operations. Implementing the data required that I learn new code to add and delete records from a database and
            testing queries forced me to understand how to properly use operators and query commands to extract specific data instances. It was really quite fun to work on this project with my team.

            A second project I worked on was an MIS Honors Research Course. I learned about the .NET Framework, .Net Core, created a second database on my own, and connected the database to an interactive website.
            This project introduced me to connection strings and front-end programming. It was in this project I was exposed to HTML and website creation. I worked one on one with a professor who is still actively working
            in database administration, which was helpful because I was shown a real-world database. After this project, I am fully educated on the extensive process from ERD creation to website completion. I know the complete
            steps taken by a company to produce the final product that consumers use, and how to step back into the code to alter it if there are adjustments to the company strategies or marketing.
